        			to dive into new technology and tackle problems even when no external resources are available.  I take pride in my work. I work to learn,
        			grow, and advance.  Over the years I have been fortunate to have this brand recognized and rewarded by my peers.  I have been granted a leadership
        			role in every job I've held since I started working at 16.
